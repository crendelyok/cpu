complie.c is a compliator. 
It requires for a code in assembler then complies it.
Complile bytecode's name is "binary".
compile.c (complile.h") needs "cvector.c", "transl.h", "transl.c", 
				"def_reg.h", "def_syntax.h", 
				"token_type.h", "def_kword.h"
Comilation of compile.c: gcc compile.c transl.c 


main.c takes a binary file(e.g. binary from complice.c) and executes it 
cpu.c (cpu.h) describes functions for execution
